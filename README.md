# Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of various software design patterns and principles. It is divided into two main exercises:

# Exercise 1 : 

Demonstrates six different use cases, each highlighting a specific design pattern (two behavioral, two creational, and two structural).
Exercise 1: Design Patterns Demonstration
          
          Behavioral Design Patterns
          Creational Design Patterns
          Structural Design Patterns


# Exercise 2 :

A mini-project where a practical application is developed using best practices and design patterns.

**Problem Statement : Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer**
